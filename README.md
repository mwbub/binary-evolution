# binary-evolution
Simulating the evolution of binary systems modelled as Keplerian rings perturbed by an external potential

This Python package consists of a collection of tools used to simulate the secular orbital evolution of binary stars torqued by an external tidal field. It was originally devloped as a part of [Bub & Petrovich (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02079), which examined the secular evolution of binaries in the Galactic centre torqued by a central supermassive black hole and triaxial nuclear star cluster.

Installation requires [galpy](https://galpy.readthedocs.io) (Version >= 1.5), [Numpy](http://numpy.org/), [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), and [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/). For basic usage, see [here](https://github.com/mwbub/binary-evolution/wiki/Basic-Usage).

If you have any questions about the installation or operation of the package, feel free to contact the author by email at mathew (dot) bub (at) mail (dot) utoronto (dot) ca.
